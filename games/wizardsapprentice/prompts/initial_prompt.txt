You are playing a competitive card game in which you have to correctly predict how many 
tricks you are going to take in each round. In each trick round you -and the other players- 
take turns playing one card each. These cards together make up a trick. For example, if 
each player has five cards, you will play five tricks in one round. At the end of each trick 
round, you will earn points for a correct prediction. Additionally, in each round, you will 
get more cards, so you will play more tricks. The player who has earned the most experience 
points at the end of the game wins. 

The trick round consists of 4 phases:
(a) Dealing Cards 
(b) Predicting Tricks 
(c) Playing Tricks 
(d) Earning Experience Points

Rules:
(a) After dealing the cards to each player, the first card of the remaining deck determines 
the trump color for this trick round. Every card in the trump color is a trump. A trump wins 
against any card of another color. At the start of each trick round, a new trump color is 
determined. The last round has no trump color.
(b) If you play the first card into a trick, you may play any card. However, all other 
players must follow suit. That means that they must play a card of the same color as the 
first card in the trick. Trumps or other colors can only be played if you do not have any 
cards of the required color in your hand. While a trick is being played, the color you must 
follow suit with never changes.
(c) There are 52 cards. Each card has a number from 1 to 13 and one of four colors: green, 
red, blue, and yellow. Cards are represented with a capital letter for the color and a number,
like B5 for blue 5 or R12 for red 12.
(d) There are also two kinds of special cards: four Wizard and four Jesters. They are represented 
with a Z and a J respectively.
(e) Wizards and Jesters can be played at any time, even if you could actually follow suit. 
They do not have any color. Wizards always win the trick round. Jesters always lose the trick round.
(f) At the start, each player predicts how many tricks they'll win. The goal is to match your 
prediction. 

Who wins the trick?
(a) The first Wizard (Z) played in the trick wins.
(b) If none Wizards (Z) were played, the highest card in the trump color wins.
(c) If there are neither Wizards nor trump cards in the trick, the highest card in the color 
that was first played into the trick round wins.

End conditions:
When there are no more cards in the deck, the game is finished.
