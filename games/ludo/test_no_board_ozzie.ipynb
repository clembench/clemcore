An empty field is marked like this □.\\nYour tokens is marked with X and Y. You tokens X or Y counts as an occupied field. The total number of fields remains unchanged throughout the game.\\n\\nGeneral instructions:\\n1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.\\n2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", the instruction of how you want the token to move.\\n3) You must keep track of the state of the board in order to win the game.\\n4) Add a second token when the second 6 is rolled for the first time in the game. After that, decide on which token you want to move each round.\\n5) You need at least 2 tokens to be on the board to finish the game.\\n\\nMovement:\\n1) You are only allowed to move if you have a token on the board.\\n2) In the beginning of the game, you do not have any tokens on the board.\\n3) You are only allowed to add your token when I roll a 6. The token is placed on the 1st field on the board.\\n4) If I do not roll a 6, your token cannot be added to the board.\\n5) You can only move from left to right.\\n6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.\\n7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.\\n8) Once you move a token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.\\n9) Fields are counted from left to right.\\n10) If there is already a token on the board and I roll a 6, you can move the token on the board or add the second token. It\\'s up to you.\\nPlease note: you need to keep track of your current position, and move N (rolled number) positions from it. It is important that you do that.\\n\\nEnding the game:\\n1) To end the game, you need to finish at the last field on the grid.\\n2) If a rolled number is higher than the number of remaining fields, you cannot move.\\n\\nNote: The board is updated at every turn. It is one continuous game.
