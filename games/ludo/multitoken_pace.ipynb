      "General instructions:\n",
      "1) Every turn I will give you the current state of the grid. You must tell me what your next move is.\n",
      "2) Your answers must contain the words \"MY MOVE:\", the instruction of how you want the token to move.\n",
      "3) You must keep track of the state of the board in order to win the game.\n",

      "5) You can only move from left to right.\n",
      "6) You are only allowed to move when I roll a die.\n",
      "7) You need to move the same number of fields as given by the roll.\n",
      "8) Once you move a token, the previously occupied field is marked with □.\n",

      "10) If there are 2 tokens on the board, think about which one to move. You want to finish the game in as few moves as possible.\n",
      "11) You have to move if I roll a die, you cannot skip turns.\n",
      "12) If there is already a token on the board and I roll a 6, you can move the token on the board or add the second token. You are free to make a decision.\n",
