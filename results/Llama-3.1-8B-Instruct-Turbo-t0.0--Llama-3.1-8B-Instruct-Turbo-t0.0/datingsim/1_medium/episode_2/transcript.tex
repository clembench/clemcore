	 I'm excited to start this game and see where it takes us. \\ \tt \\ \tt I'm drawn to Olivia's energetic presence and her love for staying active, which aligns with my own hobbies of rock climbing and hiking. \\ \tt \\ \tt I'd like to start by suggesting a casual and relaxed atmosphere for our first date. \\ \tt \\ \tt [reason] I want to get to know her better in a low-key setting. [end]\\ \tt \\ \tt [sentiment] Continue Conversation [end]\\ \tt \\ \tt [response] Hey Olivia, I noticed you're a fitness instructor and I'm a software engineer. I'm a big fan of staying active, but I also enjoy unwinding with a good cup of coffee. Would you be up for grabbing a coffee and chatting in a quiet coffee shop? [end]
